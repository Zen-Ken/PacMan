# PacMen
In this project, I play with manipulating the DOM. Using JavaScript, I can dynamically create DOM elements. This is how additional PacMan objects are added. Using the top and left properties, I manipulate and move the Pac-Man around the window. When the Pac-man reaches the borders of the webpage, a collision will be detected and the Pac-man will reverse course.

# Road Map
As a gamer, my plan for this project is to incorporate logic to create a Pac-Man replica. This will require adding user control to the project with Javascript. Once has been created, including the ghost from the original game, Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde.
